## Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore and redesign visualizations from the original study, offering a fresh perspective on the analysis and interpretation of 3D segmentation using NeRFs. This repository provides open-source data and code, making it accessible and reproducible for researchers and developers interested in 3D segmentation and NeRF technologies.

### Data

The dataset used in this analysis is openly available:

**Data**: [Segment Anything Model HQ (SAM-HQ)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sam-hq-team/sam-hq)

### Code

The original code used in the study can be accessed via GitHub:

**Code Repository**: [SysCV/sam-hq](https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq)
